# The session, over Godot's own WebSocketPeer.
#
# There is no socket abstraction here and that is the point of difference from
# the other two bindings. `WebSocketPeer` is engine-native and takes no
# injection, so this cannot share the `SocketLike` / `IHaivenSocket` seam that
# TypeScript and C# needed — and it does not need one, because Godot's socket
# already works on every target Godot ships to, which is exactly what that seam
# was buying elsewhere.
#
# What Godot does force instead is POLLING. `WebSocketPeer` has no signals of its
# own: nothing arrives unless someone calls `poll()`, so a session has to be
# driven from a frame callback. That is the shape of this class — signals out,
# a `poll()` in — and it is why an addon cannot simply be constructed and left
# alone the way the TypeScript session can.
class_name HaivenSession
extends RefCounted

# Preloaded by path rather than used as the global `HaivenProtocol` the sibling
# file declares. A `class_name` is registered from the editor's import cache, so
# a global reference makes the addon depend on having been imported — which is
# true for a consumer and false for a headless script run, and the failure is a
# parse error rather than anything that names the cause.

## Every inbound frame, before the session interprets any of it.
##
## This exists because the classified arms below are NOT exhaustive, and that is
## easy to miss. `auth.success` and `auth.expired` are consumed into
## [signal authenticated] and [signal expired], so a listener connected only to
## [signal reply_received] and [signal event_received] never sees them — which is
## correct for a game and wrong for anything that has to observe the protocol
## rather than use it. A conformance runner asserting on `auth.success` connects
## here; measured in `session_test.gd`, where connecting only the classified arms
## made the handshake reply invisible.
